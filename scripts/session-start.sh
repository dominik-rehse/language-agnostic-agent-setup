# SessionStart hook (Claude Code): inject this plugin's rules into the session
# context, read live from the plugin. There is no vendored copy in the project,
# so a plugin update applies on the next session — nothing goes stale.
#
# Migration safety: any rule a project has ALREADY vendored into
# .claude/rules/<name>.md (a legacy install) is skipped here, so there is no
# double-load during the transition. Delete the vendored copy to switch that
# rule to live injection.
#
# Mechanism: SessionStart hook stdout is injected into the session context.
